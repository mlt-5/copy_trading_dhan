- Source of truth: @docs_links.txt â†’ Orders, Swagger, Releases.
- Use exact request/response shapes and enums from docs; do not infer.

## Request model (verify exact keys and enums)
- Side, instrument identifier, quantity, price fields.
- Product, validity/TIF, trigger price for SL types.
- AMO/pre-open tags if documented; Forever/OCO specifics if applicable.

## Validation rules (confirm per docs)
- MARKET: no price.
- SL/SL-L: trigger required; validate trigger vs price bands if provided.
- Modify semantics (e.g., `quantity` as total placed quantity) and exchange/state constraints.
- Idempotency key if supported.

## Lifecycle handling
- Capture order id; poll or subscribe for updates until terminal state.
- Map statuses to typed enums; surface actionable reject reasons.
