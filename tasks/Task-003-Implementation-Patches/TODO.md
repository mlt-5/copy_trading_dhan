# Task-003: Implementation Patches - TODO

## Goal
Implement all identified gaps from Task-002 audit to make the copy trading system production-ready.

## First Principles Breakdown

### Problem
The initial codebase (Task-001) handled basic order placement but lacked critical functionality for:
- Order cancellations
- Order modifications
- Execution tracking
- Missed order recovery
- Missing order parameters (trigger price, validity, disclosed quantity)
- Rate limiting
- Market hours validation

### Solution Approach
1. **Patch WebSocket Manager**: Handle all order statuses (not just new orders)
2. **Enhance Order Manager**: Add cancel, modify, and execution handlers
3. **Fix Order Parameters**: Extract and pass all order parameters correctly
4. **Add Rate Limiting**: Implement token bucket for API calls
5. **Add Market Hours Check**: Validate trading hours before placing orders
6. **Missed Order Recovery**: Fetch and replay orders after reconnection

## Task Checklist

### Planning Phase
- [x] Review Task-002 audit findings
- [x] Prioritize critical, high, and medium issues
- [x] Plan implementation strategy
- [x] Create Task-003 folder structure

### Implementation Phase - CRITICAL Issues
- [x] Fix order cancellation handling
  - [x] Update WebSocket to handle CANCELLED status
  - [x] Add cancel_order() method to OrderManager
  - [x] Route cancellation events in main orchestrator
- [x] Fix order modification handling
  - [x] Update WebSocket to handle MODIFIED status
  - [x] Add modify_order() method to OrderManager
  - [x] Route modification events in main orchestrator
- [x] Fix missed orders during disconnect
  - [x] Add _fetch_missed_orders() to WebSocket manager
  - [x] Track disconnect/reconnect state
  - [x] Fetch orders since last_leader_event_ts on reconnection
  - [x] Pass leader_client to WebSocket manager

### Implementation Phase - HIGH Priority
- [x] Fix trigger price for SL orders
  - [x] Extract triggerPrice from leader order
  - [x] Pass to _place_follower_order()
  - [x] Include in API call for SL/SL-M orders
  - [x] Save to database
- [x] Fix validity hardcoding
  - [x] Extract validity from leader order (default: DAY)
  - [x] Pass to _place_follower_order()
  - [x] Include in API call
  - [x] Save to database
- [x] Fix execution tracking
  - [x] Add handle_execution() method
  - [x] Track filled quantity and price
  - [x] Log execution events
  - [x] Compare leader vs follower execution timing
- [x] Add rate limiting
  - [x] Implement token bucket algorithm
  - [x] Add _wait_for_rate_limit() method
  - [x] Apply to all API calls (place, modify, cancel)
  - [x] Make rate limit configurable (10 req/sec default)

### Implementation Phase - MEDIUM Priority
- [x] Fix disclosed quantity
  - [x] Extract disclosedQuantity from leader order
  - [x] Calculate proportional follower disclosed qty
  - [x] Pass to API call
  - [x] Save to database
- [x] Add market hours validation
  - [x] Implement _is_market_open() method
  - [x] Check timezone (IST)
  - [x] Validate against exchange hours
  - [x] Log warning if market closed
  - [x] Add pytz dependency

### Testing & Documentation
- [x] Update requirements.txt (add pytz)
- [x] Create comprehensive patch documentation
- [x] Document all changes with code examples
- [x] Update changelogs
- [ ] Create test scenarios for new functionality
- [ ] Update README with new capabilities

### Deployment
- [ ] Test patched code in sandbox environment
- [ ] Validate all scenarios from Task-002
- [ ] Measure latency improvements
- [ ] Deploy to production

## Constraints
- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing database
- Must not break existing order placement flow
- Must respect DhanHQ API rate limits
- Changes must be atomic and testable

## Expected Outcome
A production-ready copy trading system that:
1. âœ… Handles all order lifecycle events (place, modify, cancel, execute)
2. âœ… Recovers from disconnections without missing orders
3. âœ… Replicates all order parameters accurately
4. âœ… Respects API rate limits
5. âœ… Validates market hours
6. âœ… Tracks execution and slippage
7. ðŸ”„ Has comprehensive error handling and logging
8. ðŸ”„ Passes all test scenarios from Task-002

## Dependencies
- Task-002 audit findings (COMPREHENSIVE_SCENARIOS.md, CODE_GAPS_ANALYSIS.md)
- Existing Task-001 codebase
- DhanHQ v2 SDK documentation

## Related Files
- `/tasks/Task-002-Scenario-Analysis-Audit/analysis/CODE_GAPS_ANALYSIS.md` - Detailed fixes needed
- `/tasks/Task-002-Scenario-Analysis-Audit/analysis/COMPREHENSIVE_SCENARIOS.md` - Test scenarios
- All source files in `/tasks/Task-001-Copy-Trading-Architecture/src/`

## Status
**IN PROGRESS** - Core patches completed, testing and documentation in progress

## Notes
- All patches marked with âœ… ADDED or âœ… FIXED comments for traceability
- Rate limiting uses thread-safe deque for timestamp tracking
- Market hours validation uses pytz for accurate IST timing
- Missed order recovery queries DB for last_leader_event_ts
- All new methods have comprehensive error handling and logging
